# Composite Design Patterns in Go

The **Composite** design pattern is a structural pattern that allows you to build complex tree-like structures by composing objects into a tree-like hierarchy. It treats both individual objects (leaves) and groups of objects (composites) uniformly. This pattern is particularly useful when you want to represent a part-whole hierarchy, such as file systems, organizational structures, or UI components.

### **When to Use the Composite Pattern**

* When you want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects.
* When you want clients to treat individual objects and composites of objects uniformly.
* When you need to work with nested structures (e.g., folders containing files and other folders).

### **Components of the Composite Pattern**

1. **Component** : An interface that defines common operations for both composite and leaf nodes.
2. **Leaf** : Represents individual objects in the composition. Implements the component interface.
3. **Composite** : Represents complex components that can contain other components. Implements the component interface and manages child components.

### **Key Points of the Composite Pattern**

* **Uniformity** : Treats individual objects (`File`) and composites (`Directory`) uniformly through the `Component` interface.
* **Recursive Composition** : Composites can contain both leaves and other composites, allowing you to build complex tree structures.
* **Flexibility** : Adding new types of components (e.g., `Shortcut`) is easy because they only need to implement the `Component` interface.

### **Advantages of the Composite Pattern**

* **Simplifies Client Code** : The client can work with individual objects and groups of objects uniformly.
* **Extensibility** : New types of components can be added with minimal changes to existing code.
* **Hierarchical Structures** : Naturally supports recursive structures like directories, menus, and organizational charts.

### **Summary**

The Composite design pattern in Go allows you to create tree-like structures of objects where individual objects (`File`) and groups of objects (`Directory`) are treated uniformly. This is achieved through the use of a common interface (`Component`) and recursive composition in the composite objects (`Directory`).
