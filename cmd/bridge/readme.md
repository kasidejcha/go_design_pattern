# Bridge Design Pattern in Go

The **Bridge** design pattern is a structural pattern used to decouple an abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to vary independently. This pattern is beneficial when a class has several variations and you want to avoid creating complex hierarchies that could be difficult to maintain.

## Overview

The Bridge pattern involves:

1. **Abstraction** : An interface that defines high-level control.
2. **Implementer** : An interface for the low-level implementation.
3. **Concrete Implementer** : Concrete classes that implement the implementer interface.
4. **Refined Abstraction** : A concrete subclass of the abstraction that uses an implementer to perform its functionalities.

This pattern is particularly useful when both the abstractions and their implementations should be extensible by creating new subclasses.

## How the Bridge Pattern Helps

1. **Decoupling** : The `Shape` abstraction is decoupled from its implementation (`Renderer`), allowing them to vary independently.
2. **Extensibility** : You can introduce new shapes or rendering mechanisms without modifying the existing code.
3. **Simplicity** : Helps avoid complex inheritance structures by separating the dimensions (e.g., shapes and rendering methods).

## When to Use the Bridge Pattern

* When you want to decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that both can be extended independently.
* When you have a class explosion due to the multiplication of different implementations.
* When you want to dynamically change implementations at runtime.
