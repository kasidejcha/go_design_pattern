# Facade Design Patterns in Go

The **Facade** design pattern is a structural pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. Essentially, it acts as a "front-facing" interface that hides the complexities of a system and makes it easier to interact with. This is particularly useful when you want to provide a simpler, unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.

### **When to Use the Facade Pattern**

* When you want to simplify interactions with complex subsystems.
* When you need to provide a single point of access to multiple parts of a subsystem.
* When you want to reduce dependencies between clients and a complex system, improving code readability and maintenance.

### **Components of the Facade Pattern**

1. **Subsystem** : The complex components or classes that the facade will simplify.
2. **Facade** : A class that provides a simplified interface to the complex subsystem.
3. **Client** : The code that interacts with the subsystem through the facade.
