# Singleton Design Pattern in Go

The **Singleton** design pattern is a creational pattern that ensures a class has **only one instance** and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is useful when you want to control access to shared resources, like configuration settings, a logging object, or a database connection.

## Overview

The Singleton pattern:

1. Restricts the instantiation of a class to one object.
2. Provides a global point of access to the single instance.
3. Ensures thread safety when the instance is created.

### When to Use the Singleton Pattern

* When you need exactly one instance of a class to coordinate actions across the system (e.g., logging, configuration management).
* When a global object is necessary but should be restricted to a single instance to prevent issues such as conflicting state.

## Benefits of the Singleton Pattern

* **Controlled Access** : Ensures that there is only one instance of a class, providing a controlled access point to it.
* **Resource Management** : Useful for managing shared resources like configuration settings, logging mechanisms, or database connections.
* **Thread Safety** : By using `sync.Once` in Go, the Singleton pattern ensures that the instance is created in a thread-safe manner.

## When to Avoid the Singleton Pattern

* When it introduces global state into your application, which can make testing and debugging more challenging.
* When overused, it can lead to a less modular and more tightly coupled codebase.

## Summary

The Singleton design pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object and provides a global point of access to it. In this Go example, we used the `sync.Once` to ensure that the singleton instance is created safely in a concurrent environment. This implementation is particularly useful for managing shared resources like configurations or loggers.
